# Karyakram, An Event Management System

There are many events, functions, and programs which are conducted in university and colleges. Nowadays, our college uses facebook group and whatsapp groups to circulate events information and make it reachable to the participants. But sometime many individuals who aren't in group but are associated to college miss such events. And also the management of these event is a manual process, like deciding the host of event and coordinators, creating banners, writing messages and description of projects and sharing in respective groups and authorities. So, we planned to automate a few things which are repetitive and time consuming. We are making karyakram as a university and college event management system.
