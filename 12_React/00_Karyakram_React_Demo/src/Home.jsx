      <p>
      Colleges often rely on Facebook and WhatsApp groups to share event information, but this leaves out many associated individuals who aren’t in those groups. Additionally, event management tasks like assigning hosts, creating banners, and writing descriptions are handled manually. To address this, we're developing Karyakram — an event management system to automate repetitive and time-consuming processes in universities and colleges.
